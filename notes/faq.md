## what is Matry

Matry is a keyboard-driven UI design tool.

- allow designers to own their data, while also providing collaborative editing
- design in the target medium
- component-driven
- prioritize efficiency over familiarity
- active collaboration between designers and developers

## why was Matry created

Because while design tools have built some incredible features over the past 2 decades, they still aren't innovating enough.
All design tools are essentially drawing tools with some extra features built in.
One of Matry's core ideas is that a drawing tool is ill-suited for the needs of modern design teams.

## who created Matry

My name is Daniel Vaughn, and I'm a frontend developer who has long been interested in the working relationship between developers and designers.
